# Development-of-a-Low-Budget-Automated-Dispatch-System
The goal of this project is to build an Automated Dispatch System that simplifies inventory tracking and item dispatching in a low-cost environment. Instead of traditional RFID systems, we leverage Flutter mobile development and smartphone cameras to implement a QR code-based solution.
