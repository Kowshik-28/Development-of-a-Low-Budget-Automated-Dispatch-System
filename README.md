# 📦 Low-Budget Automated Dispatch System Using Flutter & QR Codes

This project provides a low-cost alternative to RFID-based dispatch systems using **Flutter** and **QR Code scanning**. It enables small warehouses or institutions to manage item movement and inventory efficiently with just a smartphone and printed QR codes.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📱 Mobile app built using **Flutter**
- 📦 Add and manage inventory items
- 🔍 Scan QR codes to simulate item movement (dispatch)
- 🧠 Offline storage using SQLite
- 💸 Designed to work within a **₹2000 budget**
- 🧰 Easily extendable with optional IR or proximity sensors

---

## 📲 Screens

- **Product List Screen**: View all items in the system
- **Add Product Screen**: Add new items to inventory
- **Scan Screen**: Scan QR codes to track movement

---

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

1. **Install Flutter SDK** (https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kowshik-28/Development-of-a-Low-Budget-Automated-Dispatch-System
3. Navigate to the project folder:
   cd automated-dispatch
4. Install dependencies:

## 📦 Technologies Used
Flutter + Dart

qr_flutter and qr_code_scanner for QR code handling

SQLite for local database

Android/iOS smartphone (no special hardware required)

##💡 Why Not RFID?
Method       |	Pros	                             | Cons
__________________________________________________________________________________
RFID	       | Fully automated, fast              | Expensive, hardware needed
QR + Flutter |	Cheap, flexible, smartphone-based  | Manual scanning unless automated

## 🔄 Future Improvements
IR or Proximity sensors for auto-detection

Cloud sync for real-time data access

Notifications or logs for dispatch alerts
